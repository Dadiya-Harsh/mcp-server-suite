# mcp-server-suite

**mcp-server-suite** is a customizable MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed as a foundation for all your future automation, integration, and AI-powered workflows. Built for extensibility, it enables you to create, connect, and manage custom tools and services in a modular way.

## Features

- **Model Context Protocol** core for flexible context management
- Modular architecture for adding new tools and services
- Easy integration with APIs and external systems
- Environment variable support via `.env` files
- Designed for ongoing expansion and customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Dadiya-Harsh/mcp-server-suite.git
    cd mcp-server-suite
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or, if using `pyproject.toml`:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables (e.g., `TAVILY_API_KEY`) in a `.env` file.

### Running the Server

To start the main server:
```sh
python main.py
```

To run a specific tool server (e.g., web search):
```sh
python web_search_tavily.py
```

## Adding New Tools

Add new tools by creating Python modules and registering them with the MCP server. See [`web_search_tavily.py`](web_search_tavily.py) for an example. The platform is designed to support any future tool or integration you need.
