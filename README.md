# mcp-server-suite

**mcp-server-suite** is a comprehensive collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers designed to be the "HuggingFace for automation". Our vision is to create a community-driven platform where developers can both use pre-built servers and contribute their own, making automation and AI-powered workflows accessible to everyone.

## Features

- **Model Context Protocol** core for flexible context management
- Modular architecture for adding new tools and services
- Growing collection of ready-to-use MCP servers
- Easy integration with APIs and external systems
- Environment variable support via `.env` files
- Community-driven expansion and customization

## Available Servers

### Core Servers
- **Web Search Server**: Integrate web search capabilities using Tavily API
- **File Explorer Server**: Safe file system operations with progress reporting
- **PostgreSQL Server**: Both sync and async database operations
- More coming soon!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer and resolver

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Dadiya-Harsh/mcp-server-suite.git
    cd mcp-server-suite
    ```

2. Install UV if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    pip install uv
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    uv venv
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix/macOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies using UV:
    ```sh
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

5. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
    ```sh
    # Required for web search server
    TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    
    # Required for PostgreSQL server
    DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432
    
    # Required for file explorer server
    ALLOWED_BASE_PATH=E:\Your\Safe\Path
    ```

### Running the Servers

Each server can be run independently:

```sh
# Web Search Server
python web_search/web_search_sse.py

# File Explorer Server
python file_explore/basic_file_server.py

# PostgreSQL Server (async)
python database/postgresql/async_postgresql_server.py
```

## Using the Platform

### As a User

1. Install the package:
    ```sh
    uv pip install mcp-server-suite
    ```

2. Import and use any server:
    ```python
    from mcp_server_suite.web_search import web_search_server
    from mcp_server_suite.database import async_postgresql_server
    ```
